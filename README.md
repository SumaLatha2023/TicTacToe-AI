# TicTacToe-AI

This GitHub repository hosts a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring both single-player and multi-player modes. In single-player mode, players compete against a computer AI that utilizes the minimax algorithm to optimize its moves, providing a robust challenge. Multi-player mode allows two players to compete in a classic turn-based style.

Features:
Single-Player Mode: Play against an intelligent computer AI.
Multi-Player Mode: Enjoy the game with a friend.
Interactive Board Display: Visual representation of the game board with command-line interface.

Implementation:
The game is implemented in Python, making use of simple data structures and control flow.
The minimax algorithm is used to provide an intelligent computer opponent in single-player mode.

How to Play:
Run the main() function.
Select the desired game mode.
Follow prompts to make moves using position numbers 1 through 9.

Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe against a challenging computer opponent or with friends!
